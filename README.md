# HR-Dashboard-PowerBI

**Description:**
I analyzed HR data to gain valuable insights. To achieve this, I utilized Power Query to clean the data. This involved a number of tasks such as changing data types and formats. I also calculated various measures and key performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs that I focused on included the count of total employees, count of male vs. female employees, percentage of employees due for promotion and those not due for promotion (for promotion decision-making). The dashboard includes filters that allow analysis of employee data based on department, gender, age, and job levels.
